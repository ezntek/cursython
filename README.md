# Cursython

cursython (cur-SY-thon) is a very cursed form of writing python. Instead of writing innocently innocent python code, you write JSON.

# I want the docs!

[here.](/DOCS.md)

# Quickstart

1. make sure you have the rust toolchain installed on your system (`cargo`, `rustc`, etc.)
2. issue `cargo install cursython`
3. profit

OR

1. also make sure you have the rust toolchain installed on your system.
2. clone the repository
3. issue `make clean userinstall` (with GNU make)
4. profit

Now, please run the examples by compiling it with the `cursython` command. run `cursython --help` for usage info.

# Backstory

So this youtuber [A Byte of Code](https://youtube.com/@AByteOfCode) made this video, showcasing his framework [HTML.JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK_Wnb4cVu0), where you write HTML for logic instead of JavaScript. In the comment section I wrote that I would waste 3 months of my time writing a TOML.py framework where you write python with toml, and this is the result.

It actually only took me 9 days + 5 days of procrastination, I started on the 17th of July (2023) and now it's the 26th.

With this glorious library/framework/transpiler, you can write python code with json, for some reasonâ„¢.

# Why did I use JSON/JSON5 and not TOML?

[JSON Fibonacci generator](/examples/fib_generator.py.json)

[TOML conversion](https://gist.github.com/ezntek/eadaaf6ae8632037e91ce16f6bde6254)

You can see for yourself :))

# Project for grabs

Try using HTML.js with a cherrypy web server with cursython. This way, you can confidently say that you wrote a web app without any real programming languages ;)
